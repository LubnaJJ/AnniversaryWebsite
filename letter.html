ANYWAYS, baby i literally thank Allah after every prayer for seeing that tiktok at teh right moment once after i finished praying maghrib because if i hadn't I wouldn't have gotten to know the sweetest boy that I'm in love with right now.
    I have litterally been smiling so much since the day we started yapping and i hope i make you smile too.<br>
